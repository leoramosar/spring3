                    unable to provide a field that meets these minimum
                    requirements must advise the State Competition Board which
                    will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and
                    recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the
                    minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues,
                    districts or associations that are unable to provide an
                    acceptable field may be required to play all their games
